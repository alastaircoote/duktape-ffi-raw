# duktape_ffi_raw

## What is this?

A very simple create that packages the Duktape C library for use in Rust.

## Aren't there about a dozen of these crates?

Yes. They all seem to address slightly different needs so I've added to the pile. Sorry.

## Duktape version

This currently includes version 2.3.0 of Duktape. To update it, replace the contents of the `duktape-src` directory with new code.

The version number of this crate is reflective of the Duktape version: 2.30.x is 2.3.0 of Duktape. 2.40.x will be 2.4.0, and so on.
